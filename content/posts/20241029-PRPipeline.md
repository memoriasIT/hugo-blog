As someone who works in a consultancy firm, I create many projects. This process can be tedious and repetitive. That's why creating "building blocks" can be really helpful.

I believe this is specially true for the CI/CD of the applications.
In today's post, I would like to create the (my) "perfect" PR check pipeline for your github repo.

As a Flutter developer, I often find myself inspired by the work of VeryGoodVentures. Not only is it of great quality, but it is also MIT licensed. If you are familiar with [VeryGoodWorkflows](https://www.github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_workflows/tree/main), this might feel familiar.

# Let's get to the point!

Let's first make a list of all the requirements I would like my action to have:

- **Simple:** Understanding the actions should not require a lot of knowledge.
- **Reusable:** There might be small differences between projects (architecture, versions, requirements, etc.). The actions should be flexible enough to account for that.
- **Templates:** Projects should not have to copy and paste the workflows from one project to another. This makes upgrading and modifying all workflows painful.

## What do I specifically want my PR workflow to do?

- **Vulnerability Scanner:** I would like to have some kind of automated scanner for known vulnerabilities. I actually tackled this with a tool called [OSV-scanner](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/announcing-osv-scanner-vulnerability.html). I actually made a blog post about it, [check it out here!](/blog/posts/20241213-osvscanner/)

- **PR format:** I would like to make sure that the PR titles follow the same style for future search/reference. One common style to use is the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec.

- **Analysis:** Either with dart static analysis or something like SonarCube. For simplicity I will use the default dart analysis. But I will probably tackle the implementation of SonarCube in the near future (I am intrigued by their _"new"_ dart support).

- **Tests:** Testing is can be a great safety net for errors sometimes. Let's run tests and add support for minimum coverage required.

- **Build:** I feel like this could spark controversy, as a build can take considerable time. But, personally I would like to have the assurance that what is in develop/master can be built successfully.

## "Header miscellanea

Here I will tackle everything that happens before the jobs execute. Starting by the very top, you can find the `name` and `run-name`.
They are nothing fancy, but some people don't know that you can actually have variables in the `run-name`, which allows you to be a bit creative.

```yaml
name: pull-request-check
run-name: üöÄ Kicking Off ${github.workflow} on ${github.ref_name}!
```

When a workflow can be run automatically, it's important that only one instance of the same workflow is running for the same PR. If not, it is very easy that workflows start pilling up and you either end up running out of minutes or with a big bill.

```yaml
# Cancel the active runs of the same branch of the same workflow (run only one
# at the same time)
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

Finally, you can define things like branches to target, determine when the workflow runs and what permissions does it need.

```yaml
  # Run workflow if pull request targets main/develop, master or a release branch.
  branches:
    - main
    - develop
    - master
    - "release/**"

  # It will run when the PR is opened, close & reopened, set from draft to ready
  # to review, the title/body/base is changed or the head branch was updated.
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, ready_for_review, synchronize, edited]

# Only read permission to contents and pull-requests is required, if you decide
# to expand on this workflow you might need to add more permissions
permissions:
  pull-requests: read
  contents: read
```

## Semantic title check

This is the first job I like to run for my PR check pipeline. It ensures that the PR is titled according to our spec.
I personally like to use the format of Conventional Commits.

In practice this means having something like the following:

```text
feat(MIT-33): Add `Button` component
 ^    ^    ^
 |    |    |__ Subject
 |    |_______ Scope
 |____________ Type
```

You can find more info about conventional commits in the [specifications page](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

```yaml
semanticTitle:
  runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
  steps:
    - name: ü§ñ Ensure Commit is Semantic
      uses: amannn/action-semantic-pull-request@0723387faaf9b38adef4775cd42cfd5155ed6017 # v5.5.3
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        # If PR is only a single commit we also check for the valid pattern
        validateSingleCommit: true
        # Scopes can be passed from the project itself. This will allow to
        # have custom JIRA ticket numbers. For example: "MIT-33"
        scopes: ${{inputs.scopes}}
        # If for some reason we want to skip the check in a PR we can add the
        # label "ignore-semantic-pull-request" to it to skip the check.
        ignoreLabels: |
          ignore-semantic-pull-request
```

## Vulnerability check

As I said before, I wrote a post for this section that goes in much more detail, [check it out here](https://memoriasit.com/blog/posts/20241213-osvscanner/).
Without getting too much into it, we basically use OSVScanner to check if the dependencies you use are known to have vulnerabilities.

```yaml
vulnerability-checker:
name: ü¶†Ô∏èVulnerability check
runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
steps: # Sets the SSH key to clone the repo - name: üîëSetup repo SSH key
uses: shimataro/ssh-key-action@v2
with:
key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}
known_hosts: ${{ secrets.SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS }}
if_key_exists: ignore

      # Checks out (clones) the code repo
      - name: üìöCheckout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v2
        with:
          go-version: "1.23.3"

      # Use OSV-Scanner to find known vulnerabilities in packages
      # This is not default in github runners if you use macOS just use brew (see my post for details)
      - name: ü¶†Ô∏è Vulnerability Check
        run: |
          go install github.com/google/osv-scanner/cmd/osv-scanner@v1
          osv-scanner -lockfile=./pubspec.lock
```

## Building your app

This is probably the most crucial part of the checks, we basically will check for lints and errors, tests and even build the app to make sure it's buildable.
I am aware that some people are not a big fan of actually building the apps when doing the checks, but for me it's a great way to ensure that was is getting merged won't break the CI/CD in the next release.

Although this part is a bit big, there's no need to worry. Just follow the comments.

```yaml
build:
  name: üî® Build
  defaults:
    run:
      working-directory: ${{inputs.working_directory}}

  runs-on: ubuntu-24.04

  steps:
    # We setup ssh and clone the repository
    - name: üîëSetup repo SSH key
      uses: shimataro/ssh-key-action@v2
      with:
        key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}
        known_hosts: ${{ secrets.SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS }}
        if_key_exists: ignore

        # changelog automatically, so this will be necessary.
        # You can read more about this here:
        # https://memoriasit.com/blog/posts/20241221-generatechangelog/
        fetch-depth: ${{inputs.fetchDepth}}

    - name: ‚¨áÔ∏èInstall Flutter version used in the project
      # I use FVM, which is the flutter equivalent of NPM for JS or RVM for ruby.
      # It uses a config file in the project to specify the version (.fvmrc).
      run: fvm install

    - name: ‚¨áÔ∏èGet Flutter dependencies
      run: fvm flutter pub get

    - name: ‚ö†Ô∏èAnalyze for lint errors/warnings
      run: fvm flutter analyze

    - name: üß™Run tests
      run: fvm flutter test --no-pub --coverage

    - name: üìä Check Code Coverage
      # If you are not aware of this action, it allows to get a coverage percentage.
      # And even enforce a minimum coverage.
      uses: VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_coverage@v3
      with:
        path: ${{inputs.working_directory}}/coverage/lcov.info
        exclude: ${{inputs.coverage_excludes}}
        min_coverage: ${{inputs.min_coverage}}

    - name: ‚öôÔ∏èBuild APK
      working-directory: ${{inputs.working_directory}}/android
      # In this PR check pipeline we are only worried about if the app builds,
      # for that reason, I don't worry about flavors or any input
      run: fvm flutter build apk
```
