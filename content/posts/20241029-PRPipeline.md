As someone who works in a consultancy firm, I create many projects. This process can be tedious and repetitive. That's why creating "building blocks" can be really helpful.

I believe this is specially true for the CI/CD of the applications.
In today's post, I would like to create the (my) "perfect" PR check pipeline for your github repo.

As a Flutter developer, I often find myself inspired by the work of VeryGoodVentures. Not only is it of great quality, but it is also MIT licensed. If you are familiar with [VeryGoodWorkflows](https://www.github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_workflows/tree/main), this might feel familiar.

# Let's get to the point!

Let's first make a list of all the requirements I would like my action to have:

- **Simple:** Understanding the actions should not require a lot of knowledge.
- **Reusable:** There might be small differences between projects (architecture, versions, requirements, etc.). The actions should be flexible enough to account for that.

## What do I specifically want my PR to do?

- **Vulnerability Scanner:** A couple of months ago, I discovered [OSV-scanner](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/announcing-osv-scanner-vulnerability.html). This scanner, made by Google, aggregates multiple vulnerability databases to find existing vulnerabilities affecting your project's dependencies. Pub.dev is included, so that's awesome for me! But if you do JS, Go, Rust, Python... it will be great for you too!

- **PR format:** I would like to make sure that the PR titles follow the same style for future search/reference. One common style to use is the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec.

- **Analysis:** Either with dart static analysis or something like SonarCube. For simplicity I will use the default dart analysis. But I will probably tackle the implementation of SonarCube in the near future (I am intrigued by their _"new"_ dart support).

- **Tests:** Testing is can be a great safety net for errors sometimes. Let's run tests and add support for minimum coverage required.

- **Build:** I feel like this could spark controversy, as a build can take considerable time. But, personally I would like to have the assurance that what is in develop/master can be built successfully.

## The full workflow
