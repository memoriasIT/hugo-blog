# Hello there!

I am memoriasIT. I do Flutter work professionally, but on my free time I love to tinker around.
Since I was a child I always loved creating content, so this blog is just one of my attempts to do so.

The _brand_ name (Memorias de un inform√°tico), comes from Spanish. It _more or less_ translates to "memories of an IT guy".
I started this idea when I went to college, and I would tell my story from being a noob to becoming a senior engineer.

Nowadays, I am no longer in college, but I still feel like I get to learn and do cool things everyday.
I am sure people will benefit from these experiences, and posting stuff on the interwebz is still cool for me, so if you want to join along feel free to do so!

I am present in most social media, almost always as @memoriasIT so if you read all this I would find it pretty cool if you sent some greetings.
